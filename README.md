# Introduction
This is CNN model for classifying dogs and cats made using Tensorflow and keras.

# Technical Description
I used many techniques like batch normalization, dropout and L2 regularization to increase accuracy and reduce overfitting. I achieved 89.22% accuracy in testing data and I hope to increase the accuracy in the future. Please see further details on the model and accuracy in the notebook.

# Resource
- I got the dataset from Kaggle which had 20000 images in the training data and 5000 images in the testing data
